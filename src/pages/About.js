              As a visionary AI and innovation leader with over 20 years of experience in marketing, 
              I'm now focussing my career on AI-driven innovation at the intersection of technology and business. 
              My role as an independent AI researcher and developer complements my position at Omnicom Media Group UK, where I'm committed to driving responsible AI 
              development and its practical application in marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
              My unique blend of marketing expertise and technological acumen allows me to bridge the gap 
              between AI's potential and its real-world applications. I'm passionate about transforming 
              complex AI concepts into practical solutions that enhance human capabilities rather than replace them.

        <p>
          As an advocate for neurodiversity and mental health awareness, I frequently speak about these topics. 
          My late-life autism diagnosis has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and innovation in the AI space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since experiencing burnout followed by depression and anxiety in 2017, I've been openly sharing my 
          mental health experiences. I believe that by speaking about mental health and neurodiversity, we 
          encourage others to share their stories, which is the best way to break down stigma.
        </p>
        <p>
          My autism diagnosis in 2022 has further enriched my advocacy work, allowing me to share insights 
          on both mental health and autistic experiences.
